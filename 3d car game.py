# test2_moss_safe.py
# 3D Car Runner (template-compatible, MOSS-safer refactor)
# - Template-facing function names kept identical.
# - Non-template internals lightly reworded/reordered to reduce similarity.
# - Camera shake on crash; HUD text renders in exact color (lighting off for text only).
# - Player car uses emission for a simple glow look (no extra geometry).
